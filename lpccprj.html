With the widespread application of LiDAR sensors in autonomous driving, there is a growing need for efficient LiDAR point cloud compression (LPCC). LPCC plays a critical role in effectively managing the storage, transmission, and perception of the expanding volume of LiDAR point cloud (LPC) data. However, there has been a lack of comprehensive investigations specifically focused on LPCC methods. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a systematic survey and extensive evaluation of LPCCs, aiming to summarize recent progress and inspire future research in this field. Firstly, we provide a clear picture of LPCC fundamentals, including the latest LPC datasets, distinctive attributes, evaluation metrics, and data formats. Secondly, we conduct a comprehensive review and comparison of existing LPCCs, such as image-based, octree-based, deep-learned, and other task-driven approaches. Finally, we propose a task-driven LPCC framework to meet the unique requirements of various tasks in autonomous driving. Overall, this paper will contribute to a better understanding of LPCCs and provide insights for the further development of autonomous driving systems. The proposed framework, the collected LPCC methods, as well as evaluation metrics are made publicly available on https://charwill.github.io/lpccprj.html.
